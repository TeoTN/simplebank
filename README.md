# Simple bank application

The project was built in pair as a proof-of-concept during the course *Ergonomy of Information Systems* at Wroclaw University of Technology.
It was supposed not to have any means of storing data, though few variables are pushed ad hoc to cookies and removed during logging out to provide user with possibility to interact with the website.

Functionalities required and developed are:
* Authentication
* Displaying user accounts
* Making a transfer
* Displaying a history of transfers

The application language is Polish. Styles aren't polished yet, hence there are some glitches. 
It can be run with http-server which is provided by npm.
The project was built in a mere few hours and hence we apology for its imperfections.
